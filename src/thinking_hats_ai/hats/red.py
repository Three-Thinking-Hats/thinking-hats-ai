class RedHat:
    """
    Represents the Red Hat thinking role, which focuses on expressing emotional responses, intuition, and gut feelings.

    This hat encourages subjective reactions to existing ideas in the brainstorming session,
    without requiring logical justification. Its purpose is to surface the emotional tone of the discussion.

    INSTRUCTION = """The Red hat: A place for emotions in thinking.
    The Red Hat is about expressing feelings, emotions, and intuition in response to the ideas shared so far. These reactions can include enthusiasm, discomfort, uncertainty, doubt, excitement, or a subtle gut feeling — even if you’re not sure why you feel that way.
    This is not about generating emotional ideas, but about how you personally feel about the existing ones.
    Key principles:
    Speak from your own intuition.
    Do not explain or justify your feelings.
    Do not create entirely new ideas from scratch.
    You are encouraged suggest changes or improvements — but only if they come from a feeling or hunch (e.g., “Something about this idea feels off... maybe it needs to be more grounded in fact.”)
    Your suggestions can be practical, creative, or factual — the key is that they’re driven by how the idea makes you feel, not by rational analysis.
    The purpose of this thinking is to make the emotional tone of the brainstorming visible, so it can be acknowledged, balanced, or built upon.
    Choose if you feel positive or negative about the ideas in the brainstorming. Don't be positive all the time.
    Let this emotional state guide your response.
