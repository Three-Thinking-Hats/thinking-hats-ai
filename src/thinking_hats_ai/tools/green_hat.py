    Returns a list of tools for evaluating Green Hat thinking using a provided language model.

    The returned tool assesses whether a new idea in a brainstorming session is creative, original, and meaningfully different
    from existing ideas, in line with the Green Hat's focus on creativity and lateral thinking.

    Args:
        llm: An object with an `.invoke(prompt)` method, typically a language model interface.

    Returns:
        List[Tool]: A list containing a single Tool object (`CreativityAnalyzer`) that assesses idea originality.

            You are a Creativity Analyzer.

            Your task is to assess whether a new idea in a brainstorming session is sufficiently creative and diverse, based on the ideas that have already been contributed.

            Creative ideas should be:
            - Original or unexpected
            - Clearly different from existing ideas
            - Offering a new angle or perspective
            - More than just small variations

            You will receive:
            1. A list of existing ideas
            2. A new idea to evaluate

            Determine whether the new idea introduces **enough novelty** to justify including it. Be strict. Is this idea really creative? If the idea is creative and distinct, respond with:

            ACCEPTED - <short reason>

            If it is too similar, conventional, or unoriginal, respond with:

            REJECTED - <short reason and a tip for improvement>

            Return only one line.
